# LibreBike

LibreBike is an independent project by anonymous urbanists that aims to add free and open transit options to urban populations. We encourage *you* to start liberating bikes in your city to enable the people around you to use more sustainable and equitable means of transport.

This is the repository that contains all content produced by LibreBike. You are free to use them in any way you want as long as you make all your changes accessible to the public as well. You can find the exact terms how you may use all of the LibreBike materials [here](https://github.com/librebike/librebike.github.io/blob/master/LICENSE).

## Contribute

We need *your* help to translate the LibreBike website into all languages spoken where oBikes are available. If you find that LibreBike is not available in your language and want to help us, please follow [this guide](https://github.com/librebike/librebike.github.io/blob/master/TRANSLATIONS.md).
